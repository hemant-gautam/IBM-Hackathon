# IBM-Hackathon
We have created a web app in which we are taking an audio file as input and generating the transcript of that file.We are also analysing the sentiment of the transcript.Generated transcript can be translated to Hindi,Tamil,Telugu.
App is in mysite/pollapp/music/
Some instructions:
1. Start speaking just after you click record button.Don't wait for any text showing "recording" or something.
2. Recording will automatically stop if it detects silence for a significant time.
3. When uploading, upload file using upload button and then hit transcribe.Your file name won't come after uploading.
